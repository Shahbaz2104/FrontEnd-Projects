# Simple Calculator

A lightweight, responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of the [FrontEnd-Projects](https://github.com/Shahbaz2104/FrontEnd-Projects) repository by Shahbaz2104 and serves as a foundational exercise in front-end web development.

## 🚀 Features

* Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
* User-friendly interface with intuitive button layout.
* Real-time calculation display.([GeeksforGeeks][1], [StackBlitz][2])

## 📁 Project Structure

```

* **index.html**: Defines the calculator's structure and layout.
* **style.css**: Handles the visual styling and responsiveness.
* **script.js**: Implements the calculator's functionality and logic.([Medium][3])

## 🔧 Getting Started

To view and interact with the calculator:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shahbaz2104/FrontEnd-Projects.git
   ```



2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd FrontEnd-Projects/Simple Calculator
   ```



3. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser**:
   You can double-click the `index.html` file or use a live server extension if you're using a code editor like VS Code.

## 💡 Usage

* Click on the numerical buttons to input numbers.
* Use the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`) to perform calculations.
* Press the `=` button to display the result.
* Use the `C` or `AC` button to clear the current input.([Medium][3], [about.gitlab.com][4])

## 📷 Screenshots

*Include screenshots here to showcase the calculator's interface on different devices.*

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

This project reinforces the following front-end development concepts:

* Structuring web pages using semantic HTML.
* Styling components with CSS for aesthetics and responsiveness.
* Implementing interactive features using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation.
